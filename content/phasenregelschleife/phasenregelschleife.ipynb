    "People seem to love the Russian Polivoks synthesizer]. The most interesting part is maybe the filter section. It is built without any capacitors. Instead, it uses some weird Russian opamps (KR140UD12). These are programmable opamps. With a control voltage, the gain can be changed. This filter wants to scream and can give percussive feedback responses, but can be well controlled. This filter is invented by [Vladimir Kuzmin](http://www.muztech.com/company.php). It has a lowpass and bandpass section. Instead of the original Russian opamp also the western counterparts can be used (uA776, MC1776, LM4250, NTE888). Of course, none of these parts is available anymore. I got some LM4250 from China. Besides the programmable opamp, this filter is a very simple build. No calibration trimmers or accurate tempco stages are required.\n",

The international standard 19&quot; rack system (DIN 41494 / IEC 297-3 / IEEE 1001.1) is the base for the dimension. These standards define all the parts needed to build a complete rack. here only the rails to mount the modules are used. The rails will be screwed to side panels made from wood.",
