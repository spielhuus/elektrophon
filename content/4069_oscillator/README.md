## cmos oscillator

this is an article series about the CD4069UBE. in the first article the chip is 'missused' for linear amplification and the simulation is analyzed. it is importand that the chip is unbuffered (UBE), the buffered chip will do the inverse binary logic and can not be used for linear amplification.
